### IMPORTANT NOTE!

The contents of the directories "/Data/Raw" and "/Data/Compute" are stored locally at ECMWF since they are not supposed to be re-distributed outside the organization, and tend to be too heavy to be stored in the remote repository.
Data is available upon request to the repository's main author (see repository's README file for the contact details) and prior approval from ECMWF management.
